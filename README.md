# basics-of-python
This repository contains some example files that are for people getting into the basics of Python. All contents in this repository are intended to be used for EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY. I have tried to explain how my code works thoroughly for users. Some programs are better used by people who have experience with Python programming.
If copying my code, please give credit to DDaCoder (me).
